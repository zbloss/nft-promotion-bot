## nft_post

This workflow runs every 12 hours. It loads my NFT collection from Opensea and filters down to the assets that I still own. It then downloads an image representing the NFT, and uploads it to twitter creating an advertising tweet.

## nft_reply

This workflow runs every hour. It checks for a mix of the 50 most popular and recent messages where twitter users are seeking to purchase other NFTs. It then replies to each of those with a link to my provided collection.
